			let age2 = 100;

			let name = "cree";
			let name2 = name;
			console.log(name, name2); // cree, cree
			name = "wang";
			console.log(name, name2); // wang, cree

			// Let's say we have an array
			const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];

			// and we want to make a copy of it.
			const team = players;
			// -> when coping players to team, team is a ref to the original array of players
			console.log(players, team); // players = team

			// You might think we can just do something like this:
			team[3] = "Lux";

			// however what happens when we update that array?

			// now here is the problem!

			// oh no - we have edited the original array too!

			// Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

			// So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
			const team2 = players.slice(); // -> when pass in nothing it creates a copy of array

			// one way

			// or create a new array and concat the old one in
			const team3 = [].concat(players);

			// or use the new ES6 Spread
			const team4 = [...players];
			const team5 = Array.from(players);

			// now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

			// The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

			// with Objects
			const person = {
				name: "Wes Bos",
				age: 80,
				social: {
					twitter: "twitter",
					fb: "fb",
				},
			};

			// and think we make a copy:
			const captain = person;
			captain.number = 99;

			// how do we take a copy instead?
			const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99 });
			// -> Object.assign is only 1-level deep

			// We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
			// const captain3 = {...person}; // object spread isnt in JS yet

			// Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
			const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));
			// -> JSON.stringify converts obj into string first,
			// -> then immediately use JSON.parse to parse string into obj
